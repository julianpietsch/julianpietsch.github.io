title: Life in motion

Change is fundamental to all living things. In order to thrive, cells must
grow and divide and organisms must adapt to changing environments. Change
generates dynamic signals in cells and cells themselves maintain internal
rhythms. Despite this ubiquity, the temporal organisation of the cell remains
poorly characterised, largely because unsynchronised dynamic processes must be
characterised live in single cells, which typically limits studies of dynamic
phenomena to low-throughput techniques like time-lapse microscopy.

My research pairs the creative application of fluorescent reporters with the
development of new computational methods designed to maximise the information
gained in a single experiment and increase the throughput achievable with
time-lapse microscopy. Using microfluidics for precise temporal control of a
cell's microenvironment, I am investigating fluctuations in central carbon
metabolism in the bacterium *E. coli*, developmental stages in motile
filamentous cyanobacteria exposed to oxygen gradients, and cellular ageing and
fitness in budding yeast.

## Software

### BABY

![BABY logo](/assets/images/BABY-logo.png){: .align-left} The Birth Annotator
for Budding Yeast (BABY) is an image processing algorithm to detect and
segment objects that overlap. This is often the case for organisms that divide
asymmetrically, like budding yeast. Small buds can often be found hidden under
their sisters or mother.

### BABY-GUI

![BABY-GUI logo](/assets/images/BABY-GUI-logo.png){: .align-left} The BABY-GUI
is a user interface that can be used to annotate and curate time-lapse imaging
data of cells and their lineages. It is particularly powerful as a tool for
inspecting and curating long time-lapses of cells held in traps or trenches.
It features parallel views of multiple channels and time-points and summary
graph that facilitates quick detection of tracking errors. It is stand-alone
software, but works best when paired with the BABY algorithm.
